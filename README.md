#protein sequence classification using natural vector and convex hull method

This is a novel protein kinase classification method that considers both domain sequence similarity and whole sequence similarity to quantify the evolutionary distance from a specific protein to a protein family. Using the natural vector method, we establish a 60- dimensional space, where each protein is uniquely represented by a vector. We also define a convex hull, consisting of the natural vectors corresponding to all members of a protein family. The sequence similarity between a protein and a protein family therefore can be quantified as the distance between the protein vector and the protein family convex hull. We have applied this method in a PKC sample library.
